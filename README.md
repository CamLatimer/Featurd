Rappers, DJ's, and other musicians often collaborate with one another. Songs often include 'features' from other musicians. For the curious, this app is intended to be a quick way to look up who has worked with who, and check out a visual representation of an artist's network.

MVP Goals:

At a basic level, the app should allow for a user to execute a search for an artist and see all of a chosen artist's collaborators.

In particular, these should be in place:

* A front end with a solid search input functionality and a visualization feature that is more than just a list of the collaborators.

* A backend that connects to a database of songs and artists that the front end can interact with.

* Deployed and accessible publicly with no bugs.

To check out the project locally, get credentials from spotify for creating an app.  Then clone or download the repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, and go to http://localhost:8080 in a browser.
